<h2 id="kaimuki-ymca"><a href="http://www.kaimukiymca.org/">Kaimuki YMCA</a></h2>

<p>Faced with the challenges of recruiting and retaining employees, the Kaimuki YMCA wanted
to take advantage of the Google for Jobs service so that their job postings would have
higer visibility for job seekers. Not having the technical staff familiar with the structured
data that could be added to the job posting pages, I created a web page to make it easy
to create the structured data to add to their website so that Google searches for jobs
will put their job openings at the top of searches
(see <a href="https://jobs.google.com/about/">https://jobs.google.com/about/</a>). Demo it
<a href="https://russtoku.github.io/job-posting-formatter/job-posting.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3rd-place-in-the-hawaii-machine-learning-meetup-challenge">3rd Place in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/hawaiiml0/">Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup Challenge</a></h2>
<p>The organizers of the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Hawaii-Machine-Learning/">Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup</a> group
put on a friendly competition to predict the amount of items that would purchased based on real retail store
sales data. My team, BFBI, took 3rd place out of a field of ten.</p>

<h2 id="code-for-hawaii"><a href="http://www.codeforhawaii.org/">Code for Hawaii</a></h2>

<p>I contributed work that help bring the <a href="https://uipa.org/">UIPA</a> website to life.
There, citizens make freedom of information request to Hawaii state and county
departments. UIPA stands for Uniform Information Practices Act.</p>

<p>I was on the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/idelve">iDelve team</a> and <a href="https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment">Team
Fossil</a>.</p>

<p>Team Fossil did a data visualization of campaign contributions by industry
