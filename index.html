<h1>Things I’m doing</h1>
<h2>UIPA.org upgrade - 2024 to current</h2>
<p>I'm helping out with the
<a href="https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/uipa/issues/43">initiative</a> for a new and
improved UIPA.org website. The <a href="https://codewithaloha.org/">Code With Aloha</a>
group is headed down one path. But I'm also investigating an alternate path.</p>
<p>In 2016, as a volunteer member of Code for Hawaii, I worked on a very small
portion of the Django web app that was deployed as the production version of
<a href="https://uipa.org/">UIPA.org</a> in 2018. I was out of the picture by the time
things went live that September. Code for Hawaii died and was resurrected as
Code With Aloha (see <em>Our timeline</em> at https://codewithaloha.org/).</p>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/Olical/conjure">Conjure</a> - 2023 to current</h2>
<p>I submitted several pull requests that have been accepted and merged into
Conjure. The PRs were small improvements for various programming language
clients supported by Conjure. See the latest release,
<a href="https://github.com/Olical/conjure/releases/tag/v4.53.0">v4.53.0</a>.</p>
<p>I also try to help others on Conjure's Discord site.</p>
<p>Conjure provides interactive evaluation of various languages in the Neovim
editor. Originally developed for Clojure, it also supports other Lisp languages
like Fennel, Racket, Scheme, Guile, Common Lisp and Janet. Some non-Lisp
languages are also supported like Julia, Rust, Lua, and Python.</p>
<p>I made some notes about <a href="posts/nvim-and-repls.html">sending code blocks</a> to a
subprocess running a REPL (interactive program) for a programing language.</p>
<p>I'm enjoying starting to use Fennel for Neovim stuff. I wrote a quick post
about this <a href="posts/nfnl-experience.html">experience</a>.</p>
<h1>Things I’ve done</h1>
<h2><a href="https://github.com/swill/kad">Keyboard Automated Design (KAD)</a> - 2022</h2>
<p>I submitted a pull request that has been accepted and merged into <code>kad</code>. This
fix is used to generate EPS files. I use <code>kad</code> to generate EPS files to get
laser cut switch plates from <a href="https://www.ponoko.com/">Ponoko</a> to build
hand-wired mechanical keyboards for computers.</p>
<h2>Parallel copy and checksum - 2019</h2>
<p>While doing system administration work for the Information Technology Services
department at the University of Hawaii, the disk arrays were upgraded several
times and virtualized disk volumes were often resized. Frequently files needed
to be copied from one virtualized volume to another due to the peculiarities of
the disk arrays, volume management software, etc. These activies were often
performed during a scheduled outage.</p>
<p>To ensure that we didn't waste time during the outages, I wrote a Go program,
<code>pcopy</code>, to copy a lot of files from one directory to another. It was also
crucial to ensure the integrity of the data so there's a companion Go program,
<code>psha1sum</code>, to generate the SHA1 checksums of the files in the destination
directory. Then the checksums generated by the copy program can be compared to
verify that no data has been mangled before proceeding with the next steps of
the data migration.</p>
<h2><a href="http://www.kaimukiymca.org/">Kaimuki YMCA</a> - 2018</h2>
<p>Faced with the challenges of recruiting and retaining employees, the Kaimuki
YMCA wanted to take advantage of the Google for Jobs service so that their job
postings would have higer visibility for job seekers. Not having the technical
staff familiar with the structured data that could be added to the job posting
pages, I created a web page to make it easy to create the structured data to
add to their website so that Google searches for jobs will put their job
openings at the top of searches
(see <a href="https://jobs.google.com/about/">https://jobs.google.com/about/</a>). Demo it
<a href="https://russtoku.github.io/job-posting-formatter/job-posting.html">here</a>.</p>
<h2>3rd Place in the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/hawaiiml0/">Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup Challenge</a> - 2018</h2>
<p>The organizers of the
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/Hawaii-Machine-Learning/">Hawaii Machine Learning Meetup</a>
group put on a friendly competition to predict the amount of items that would
purchased based on real retail store sales data. My team, <em>BFBI</em>, took 3rd place
out of a field of ten.</p>
<h2><a href="https://codewithaloha.org/">Code for Hawaii</a> - 2016</h2>
<p>I contributed work that helped bring the <a href="https://uipa.org/">UIPA.org</a> website
to life. UIPA stands for Uniform Information Practices Act. The public can make
<em>freedom of information</em> requests to Hawaii state and county departments. The
website was deployed in September 2018.</p>
<h2>The first Hawaii Annual Code Challenge <a href="https://hacc.devpost.com/">HACC 2016</a></h2>
<p>I was on the <a href="https://devpost.com/software/idelve">iDelve team</a> and <a href="https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment">Team
Fossil</a>.</p>
<p>Team Fossil did a data visualization of campaign contributions by industry
groups. The written submission can be found at
<a href="https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment">https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment</a>
and the visualization can be found at
