# Some things I've been involved in

## The first Hawaii Annual Code Challenge [HACC 2016](https://hacc.devpost.com/)

I was on the [iDelve team](https://devpost.com/software/idelve) and [Team
Fossil](https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment).

Team Fossil did a data visualization of campaign contributions by industry
groups. The written submission can be found at
[https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment](https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment)
and the visualization can be found at
[https://hacc2016.github.io/teamfossil/visualization/](https://hacc2016.github.io/teamfossil/visualization/).


## [Code for Hawaii](http://www.codeforhawaii.org/)

I contributed work that brought the [UIPA](https://uipa.org/) website to life.
There citizens make freedom of information request to Hawaii state and county
departments. UIPA stands for Uniform Information Practices Act.

## [Kaimuki YMCA](http://www.kaimukiymca.org/)

I created a web page that they can use to easily create the job posting structured data to add to their
website pages so that Google searches for jobs will pop up their job openings at the top of searches (see [https://jobs.google.com/about/](https://jobs.google.com/about/)). Demo it
[here](https://russtoku.github.io/job-posting-formatter/job-posting.html).
