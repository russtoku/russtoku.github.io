# Some things I've been involved in

## The first Hawaii Annual Code Challenge [HACC 2016](https://hacc.devpost.com/)

I was on the [iDelve team](https://devpost.com/software/idelve) and [Team
Fossil](https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment).

Team Fossil did a data visualization of campaign contributions by industry
groups. The written submission can be found at
https://devpost.com/software/campaign-contributions-by-industry-segment
and the visualization can be found at
https://hacc2016.github.io/teamfossil/visualization/.


## [Code for Hawaii](http://www.codeforhawaii.org/)

I contributed work that brought the [UIPA](https://uipa.org/) website to life.
There citizens make freedom of information request to Hawaii state and county
departments. UIPA stands for Uniform Information Practices Act.
