  <h1>Enhance your Neovim with Fennel</h1>
<p><em>Last update: 07/31/2023</em>
<br><a href="/">Back to home</a>
<br><a href="/posts/">Back to Posts</a></p>
<p>This is a report about my experience using the
<a href="https://github.com/Olical/nfnl">nfnl</a> plugin by Oliver Caldwell to
create a plugin for Neovim. <code>nfnl</code> allows me to use <em>Fennel</em> instead of
<em>Vimscript</em> (<em>VimL</em>). Many thanks, Oliver!</p>
<p>Of course, this won't work with Vim because we're using Fennel compiled to Lua
to make Neovim behave the way we want it to. Neovim understands both VimL and
Lua. Nice!</p>
<p><em>Truth in advertising:</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>You will need to learn some Vimscript and Lua and how to script Vim when you
venture into writing plugins or setting up configurations. So many ways of
doing things. It hard to keep things straight and know when to use what for
the problem you're trying to solve.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Set Up For A Plugin</h2>
<p>For this example, we'll use <code>my-plugin</code> as the plugin name.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/Olical/nfnl#installation">Install the nfnl</a> plugin and
restart Neovim.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create project directory and switch to it.</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mkdir my-plugin
$ cd my-plugin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Add these subdirectories:</p>
<ul>
<li>fnl/my-plugin/</li>
<li>lua/my-plugin/</li>
<li>plugin/</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-bash">$ mkdir -p lua/my-plugin fnl/my-plugin plugin
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Add this configuration to <code>.nfnl.fnl</code> at the top of the project directory.</p>
<pre><code class="language-fennel">{:source-file-patterns [&quot;fnl/**/*.fnl&quot;]}
</code></pre>
<p>This configuration will keep the <em>.fnl</em> and <em>.lua</em> files in separate
directories using a parallel directory structure. If you don't mind them
being in the same directory, then don't use separate directories and just put
<code>{}</code> in your <code>.nfnl.fnl</code> file.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Add The Code</h2>
<p>For this example, we'll assume all the hard work of figuring out what to implement in code is done.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Create <code>plugin/my-plugin.vim</code> with this inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-viml">if has(&quot;nvim&quot;)
  lua require(&quot;my-plugin.main&quot;).init()
endif
</code></pre>
<p>When this plugin loads, it will cause the <code>init</code> function in <em>main.lua</em> to be
run. A deeper explanation of this is beyond this report. See <code>:he write-plugin</code>
for more about writing plugins.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Create <code>fnl/my-plugin/main.fnl</code> with this inside:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fennel">(local {: autoload} (require :nfnl.module))
(local core (autoload :nfnl.core))

(local mod {})

(local msg &quot;Tears began to fall from my-plugin! -- Frank Z made me do it.&quot;)

(fn mod.init []
  (print &quot;This is msg:&quot; msg)
  (print &quot;  Now just a part of it: &gt;&quot; (string.sub msg 5) &quot;&lt;&quot;))

mod
</code></pre>
<p>Alternative to using a <em>local mod</em> variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-fennel">(local {: autoload} (require :nfnl.module))
(local core (autoload :nfnl.core))

(local msg &quot;Tears began to fall from my-plugin! -- Frank Z made me do it.&quot;)

(fn init []
  (print &quot;This is msg:&quot; msg)
  (print &quot;  Now just a part of it: &gt;&quot; (string.sub msg 5) &quot;&lt;&quot;))

{: init} ;; Export only these functions. The rest are &quot;local&quot;.
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Compile The Fennel Code</h2>
<p>Just save your Fennel file. That's it!</p>
<p><code>nfnl</code> will recognize your <code>.nfnl.fnl</code> file and take it from there.</p>
<p>The first time that you save the first Fennel file, <code>nfnl</code> will
prompt you to confirm that it is OK to proceed. You'll see something like this in
the command output area.</p>
<pre><code>.../my-plugin/.nfnl.fnl is not trusted.
[i]gnore, (v)iew, (d)eny, (a)llow: a

</code></pre>
<p>You will only need to have the <code>nfnl.fnl</code> file in the top level directory of
your project. The confirmation question will only be asked the first time that
you save a Fennel file anywhere under your project directory.</p>
<p>The project directory structure looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>├── .nfnl.fnl
├── fnl
│   └── my-plugin
│       └── main.fnl
├── lua
│   └── my-plugin
│       └── main.lua
└── plugin
    └── my-plugin.vim
</code></pre>
<h2>Install Your Plugin</h2>
<p>So now that everything is working, we add the <code>my-plugin</code> plugin to our Neovim
configuration. This will depend on which plugin manager you use.</p>
<h2>Testing The Plugin</h2>
<p>When you start Neovim without any arguments, you should see this message appear below the
status line:</p>
<pre><code>This is msg: Tears began to fall from my-plugin! -- Frank Z made me do it.
  Now just a part of it: &gt; s began to fall from my-plugin! -- Frank Z made me do it. &lt;
</code></pre>
<p>This is confirmation that the plugin is being loaded and called successfully.
<em>Hello, world!</em></p>
<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>It was much easier to create the plugin using <code>nfnl</code> compared to <code>Aniseed</code>.
There's less setup and things to do to get things to work.</p>
<p>I recommend using this as just one way to start to create plugins.</p>
<p>It all appears so easy now but the truth is I fumbled around a lot before
things came together. I tried setting up a plugin using Oliver's
<a href="https://github.com/Olical/aniseed">Aniseed</a>. That experience of getting the
equivalent of a <em>Hello, world!</em> program running was used here.</p>
<h3>The Good News :-)</h3>
<p>The plugin's author quickly responded to my problem with the plugin not
automatically compiling a Fennel file. I was using
<a href="https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim">Packer</a> and some unknown reason
(probably my unfamiliarity with Fennel, Lua, and Aniseed) the <em>FileType</em>
autocmd wasn't created for <code>nfnl</code>. That's not a problem any more and things
<em>just work</em>.</p>
