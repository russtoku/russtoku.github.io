  <h1>Thoughts on the initiative to upgrade UIPA.org</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>How does one go about upgrading a working website? While many strategies are
available, selecting one that will get the job done is difficult because &quot;you
don't know what you don't know&quot;. Advice is plentiful and readily available but
it's of no use for the same reason.</p>
<p>The kind folks of Code With Aloha have settled on upgrading by switching to the
current version of Froide because it works with Django 4.2 and Python 3.10. Both
are supported until the end of 2024.</p>
<p>I think that upgrading the old version of Froide in-place is a better approach
because it follows the guidelines of:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Keep it simple.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Less is more.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;What problem are we trying to solve?&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Upgrading in-place means taking version of Froide that the production UIPA.org
site is built from and changing it to make it work with newer versions of Python
and Django. Unlike the current versions of Froide, this doesn't add more
functionality to what is already working. It also doesn't attempt to contribute
back anything to the Froide code base because it uses a smaller subset of the
current Froide code base.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>In 2016, I got involved with Code for Hawaii and did a tiny amount of work on
one small part of the <a href="https://uipa.org/">UIPA.org</a> website.</p>
<p>UIPA.org is a website where citizens can request information from a government
agency. The website stores the requests and helps with the interaction with the
agencies. This is known as a freedom of information portal. In Hawaii, the
freedom of information law is the <a href="https://oip.hawaii.gov/laws-rules-opinions/uipa/">Uniform Information Practices Act (UIPA),
HRS Chapter 92F</a>, which
requires open access to government records. Hence the name UIPA.org which the
Public First Law Center runs. It has some information about <a href="https://publicfirst.wpenginepowered.com/uipa-requests/">requesting public
records</a> which
describes the process of requesting records.</p>
<p>The software for UIPA.org was built upon the open source
<a href="https://froide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Froide</a> portal which is used by
<a href="https://fragdenstaat.de/">Frag den Staat</a>, the German Freedom of Information
Portal.</p>
<p>UIPA.org went live in September 2018. It was a time of Python 2.x and Django
1.10.</p>
<p>From then to 2024, Code for Hawaii went through some changes and became <a href="https://codewithaloha.org/">Code
With Aloha</a> but UIPA.org's software was never
touched after being launched. The person that created UIPA.org dropped out and
prefers not to be involved again.</p>
<p>The Public First Law Center's executive director, Brian Black, the new
organizers of Code With Aloha met about getting the software updated. It's now
the time of Python 3.13 and Django 5.2. There is a newer version of Froide with
new features and dependencies. In other words, lots of moving parts to account
for that weren't there before.</p>
<p>What to do? So, how can UIPA.org be brought up to modern times?</p>
<p>Code With Aloha has an initiative called <a href="https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/uipa/issues/43">A new and improved
UIPA.org</a> on their <a href="https://github.com/orgs/CodeWithAloha/projects/14">UIPA.org
Development Board</a>.</p>
<p>This post is about exploring a different choice. I believe that it's better to
keep things as simple as possible. Let's not add more complexity and unknowns
to what is already a lot of unknowns.</p>
<h2>A path of discovery</h2>
<p>I tend to agree with the Zen of Python that simpler is better and explicit
is better. The problems that I've had writing or fixing software have to do
with not knowing what's supposed to be working. I use to ask one of my project
managers, &quot;What does done look like?&quot;. That would always make her angry, like
&quot;Don't you know?&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course not! If it's not spelled out explicitly, you're leaving too much to
chance and almost guaranteeing failure.</p>
<p>I have experienced this when I first became a software developer. At the end of
the first interview with a client (a manager position) about what the scope of
work would be, he asked me when it would be done. He had just rattled off a high
level description of what the new system was to do.</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn't give him an answer to when it would be done because
I didn't know specifically what would be needed. He wasn't able to provide much
more detail. &quot;Shouldn't he have known better since he had been in IT before?&quot;,
I wondered to myself.</p>
<p>Since then I've been trying to figure out how to make sure that I can give the
client what they need and get it to them in a reasonable time.</p>
<p>The way forward is like an explorer trying to get to some destination that
no one's been to before. This is what software development is really like
because when you want to modify code, most of the time you're hoping that it
works. You're also hoping that it's going to get you where you think you should
be.</p>
<p>My goal with this post is to describe an alternate path and report back whether
or not that path reached the intended destination, a <em>new and improved
UIPA.org</em>.</p>
<h2>Initial forays</h2>
<p>One of the first things that I try to do with existing software is to try to
run it. With modern version control systems like <em>git</em>, this is fairly easy.
Just clone the repo and follow the instructions if any. Of course, things don't
always work; not even the tenth time or ever. There are various reasons but I'm not
going to talk about that.</p>
<p>Assuming things do run then you're faced with <em>what problem are we trying to
solve?</em>. Often, what someone says is the problem isn't detailed enough to
clearly state what done looks like. You need to know the differences are between
<em>need</em>, <em>should</em>, and <em>want</em>.</p>
<h3>Upgrade Django</h3>
<p>I tried to see if the UIPA.org code be run with Django 4.x instead of 1.10.2.
Didn't work. I got an error that I couldn't resolve at that time. Definitely
a show-stopper.</p>
<h3>Make a roadmap</h3>
<p>I quickly read through the release notes for the Django versions from 1.11 to
4.2 and made
a <a href="https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/blob/update/docs/Roadmap.md">roadmap</a> of
what things might change or pitfalls that I might encounter.</p>
<h3>Just upgrade to the next version</h3>
<p>OK, take things one step at a time. I tried to see if I could fix things and get
Django 1.11 to work with UIPA.org. Didn't work. There was that same error that
I couldn't figure out and web searches didn't help. I gave up and didn't dive
deeper into the code.</p>
<p>However, several months later, I finally figured out how to fix that error and
have upgraded to Django 1.11.17 with Python 3.8. This is reflected in the
<a href="https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/tree/update">update branch</a> in my fork of the
UIPA.org repo.</p>
<h2>It seems to work for Code With Aloha</h2>
<p>Tyler Chong with Code With Aloha was able to get a new version of Froide
working but he didn't know that UIPA.org is based on using a Froide Theme and
not directly on Froide. He was able to make that change so that what's in the
<a href="https://github.com/CodeWithAloha/uipa">uipa repo</a> runs with something that
looks what a <em>new and improved UIPA.org</em> would look like. So that's the
starting point of the initiative.</p>
<h2>Oh, they're just apps. Not!</h2>
<p>For those of you who aren't familiar with Django, a Django website is
usually made up of one or more <em>apps</em> where an <em>app</em> provides a reusable amount
of functionality. This should allow you to have modular pieces that you can mix
and match and reuse for new websites.</p>
<p>The newer version of Froide has more functionality than the old one that
UIPA.org uses. The newer version has features like campaigns, GEO locations,
payments, and more. However, I'm skeptical that going with the newer version is
a good idea because it's not clear what should be done with the new
functionality. Should they be hidden? Should they be removed?</p>
<p>I tried removing one new functionality by changing the Django <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code>
configuration. Didn't work. The new functionality was mixed into existing
<em>apps</em>. You can't just leave one out because the other ones may depend on it.</p>
<p>Another thing is the idea of a themeable Django <em>app</em>. This means that you pull
in another Django project as a library dependency and your project overrides the
look and feel of the dependency. Froide has a Froide Theme that is supposed to
be used as the project to build your website on top of. The Froide Theme then
installs Froide as a dependency when you run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>.</p>
<p>For Hawaii, the form provided by the Office of Information Practices has
a section where the requester can ask for a waiver of the fees for the office
preparing the information for the request. To handle this requirement, Froide
was installed as an <em>editable dependency</em> and its code modified to change the
way that information requests are made by a user.</p>
<p>While Froide is broken out into what looks like separate <em>apps</em> and must be
configured like <em>apps</em>, that doesn't mean that you can leave any out of the
<code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> list and things will still work. It's not modular and
mix-and-match. Two repos must be maintained; one for the UIPA <em>theme</em> and one
for the modified Froide.</p>
<h2>Back to the beginning</h2>
<p>So, where does one start?</p>
<p>In Alice in Wonderland, Lewis Caroll writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;If you don't know where you want to go, then it doesn't matter which path you
take.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The beginning?</h3>
<p>The beginning is &quot;what problem are we trying to solve&quot;. Well, that's easy! <em>A
new and improved UIPA.org</em>! Not enough detail.</p>
<p>Newer versions of the software bill of materials (SBOM)? That's not enough.</p>
<p>We need to determine the desired functionality.</p>
<h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Instead of talking about implementation details, let's consider what a citizen
wants UIPA.org to help them <strong>get done</strong>. This is typically referred to as the
functionality. Traditionally, they are captured as the <em>functional
requirements</em>.</p>
<p>There are various tools and techniques for gathering the functional
requirements such as user stories, user mapping, process mapping, etc.</p>
<p>I think the most basic technique is to list out what a person does when they are
trying to get something done. That means identifying:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are they trying to get &quot;done&quot;?</li>
<li>What pieces of information are they working with?</li>
<li>What steps do they need to take?</li>
<li>What things does the system do when the user isn't directly interacting with
it?</li>
</ul>
<p>For websites, it's good to have a site map. In its simplest form, this is a list
of pages (helps to have a name and short description of what it is or does) and
the connections between them. Typically, it's represented by a drawing of boxes
and lines that connect them from top (home page) to the lowest (or farthest
away from the home page) pages.</p>
<p>One of the problem we have is that there is no list of functionality.</p>
<p>I created a <a href="https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/blob/update/docs/uipa-site-map.md">site
map</a> based
on my <a href="https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/tree/update">upgrade branch</a>.</p>
<h2>So what now?</h2>
<p>It would very helpful if others continue expanding the site map with what can be
done with UIPA.org. This would help with building a test suite to help tell us
what done looks like.</p>
<p>The alternate approach I'm exploring is an in-place upgrade. It starts with
modifying the old UIPA theme and old Froide software to work with the new
versions Django and Python instead of jumping to a new version Froide. I have
a <a href="https://github.com/russtoku/uipa/blob/update/docs/Roadmap.md">roadmap</a> for
this alternate path. I'm going to pursue it while the others follow the
mainstream.</p>
<p>I plan to build tests for each of the items on the functionality list. As I go,
I'll update the status of things on the roadmap and write more posts about my
experiences. At the same time, I will also help out the mainstream effort.</p>
